## ✅ Results Achieved  
- Combined and analyzed data from multiple CSV files previously retrieved via SQL  
- Explored the relationship between **destination neighborhoods**, **taxi company activity**, and **weather conditions**  
- Created visualizations to identify the top 10 most requested drop-off locations  
- Compared the number of trips among the top 30 taxi companies  
- Tested hypotheses related to weather impact on trip duration, specifically on rainy Saturdays  
- Applied statistical tests (e.g., `ttest_ind`) to validate findings  
- Delivered actionable insights based on exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy  
- **SQL queries** were executed to prepare the data before Python analysis  
- **Techniques applied:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Grouped visualizations and ranking
  - Hypothesis testing with statistical validation
  - Interpretation of business-relevant trends in data
